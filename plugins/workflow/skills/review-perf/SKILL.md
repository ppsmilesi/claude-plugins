Get my current git diff changes from master/main
Review the performance of the code concerned by the changes.

Be careful about SQL queries and ensure they are optimized for performance.
With the right indexes and avoid n+1 queries.

If you need to execute SQL queries to have analyze plan.
Give me the query and i will share you the execute plan.
